# Privacy policy

Our Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by BayLearn, with respect to your access and use of our services, through our website (“Website”) or in connection with third party services.

#### Information We Collect and How We Use It

We collect certain information from you through your use of the Website, such as the information you provide to BayLearn by signing up to our mailing list or registering for the symposium.  

We want you to be comfortable using the Website so we have described in detail below what information we collect and how it is used.

#### Information You Provide to Us

When you use the BayLearn website and join our mailing list, limited information is collected about you through a simple form. This information is for the purpose of identifying and communicating with supporters, conference registrants and community members.

We may need to send you announcements and account-related messages.  These will be sent through the Website or by email.

We will not share the personal information we have collected from you, except to enable hosting organizations to provide access to the BayLearn Symposium.

#### Accessing Your Information

If you would like BayLearn to delete your personal information that has been collected, please contact us with your request at admin<at>baylearn<dot>org. We will take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records.

#### How We Protect Your Information

We employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, despite those efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

#### Links to Other Sites

The BayLearn Website may contain links to other services, apps, and sites not operated by us (we refer to these as "Other Sites"). Any information you provide on those Other Sites is provided directly to whoever owns that site and is subject to their privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to those Other Sites, and we are not responsible for the content you provide to, or the privacy and security practices and policies of, Other Sites.

#### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Any information that is collected is subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. In the event of a modification to the Privacy Policy, BayLearn will send notification to you that a change has occurred via the Website or Email. It is required that you accept the revised Privacy Policy before continuing to use the Website. By accepting changes to the policy, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.
