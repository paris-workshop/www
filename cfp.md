Call for Papers - PaRiS 2025
-----------------------------
It has been long argued that personalizing search can be very helpful. In recent years, with the proliferation of personal computing devices and a large number of logged-in experiences, search has evolved to a stage with many different product scenarios where personalization plays a crucial role in relevance quality, and user satisfaction. Though search context plays a big role in determining the relevance of a given result, the utility of a search system for its users can be further enhanced by providing personalized results as well as recommendations within the search context. Moreover, with recent developments in Large Language Models and Generative AI, personalization in the context of search has become even more relevant. For example, searching via conversational systems to find something relevant to shop.

A variety of solutions have been developed for search engines in e-commerce systems, streaming/media content providers, social network systems, and even web search systems for such tasks. However, the research discussions around personalization and recommendations for search remain fragmented across different conferences and workshops. We feel that there is a strong need for bringing together researchers and practitioners working on these problems for a robust discussion and sharing of ideas. Hence, we are calling for extended abstract submissions at the PaRiS 2025 workshop, where we are bringing all applications and approaches developed to incorporate personalization and recommendation in search algorithms for the third time. This workshop to be held with KDD 2025 welcomes submissions from academia and industry researchers and practitioners to submit their work related to personalization and recommendations in search. Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop and will be published in the companion (workshop) proceedings of KDD 2025.

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop but will not be archived. Hence we encourage submissions of any relevant recent work even if that might have been presented in or submitted to other venues. We also encourage submissions that discuss work in progress in order to facilitate wider discussions.

The topics of interest are (but not limited to) listed below:
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Use of generative AI and LLMs for personalization of search systems.
* Personalizations and recommendations for conversational assistants.
* Personalized query interpretation and intent disambiguation.
* Incorporating user context in real-time or in-session adaptation for personalization in search.
* Using the user’s search session history for personalization and recommendation.
* Personalized evidence generation and explainability of search results.
* Fairness and privacy in personalized search.
* Latency, caching, and other infrastructural considerations for real-world personalized search systems.
* Learnings and challenges for developing large-scale personalized search systems.
* Leveraging different modalities of data, including text, image, and audio for the personalization of search.
* New learning to rank (LTR) approaches for search personalization as well as beyond traditional LTR approaches, such as reinforcement learning for search personalization.
* Joint modeling of search and recommendation.
* New applications for personalization and recommendations for search(e.g. in healthcare).
* Evaluation metrics for personalization and recommendation in search
* Optimization of delayed user behavioral rewards for personalization and recommendations in the context of search.
* Human-computer interaction considerations in designing personalized Search user interfaces and interaction.
* Datasets or design of simulator for personalized retrieval.
* Infrastructure for sparse and dense retrieval for a personalized Search and Recommendations experience.

Paper submission
------------------
Two page extended abstract reporting original results, preliminary results, and proposals for new work, will be considered for presentation/poster session at the workshop. We welcome research that has been previously published or is under review elsewhere. Manuscripts must be self-contained and in English with 2 pages in length plus references. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM guidelines (e.g., using the ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf here) and selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. After uploading your submission, please verify the copy stored on the EasyChair site. Please follow other guidelines for formatting submissions as indicated in the main conference page: KDD

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and present the paper. The deadline for paper submission is 1st of June 2025. Papers can be submitted through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=paris25
